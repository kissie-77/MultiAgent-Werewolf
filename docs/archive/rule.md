## 3. Game Phases and Flow

### Phase Order

```
SETUP → NIGHT → [SHERIFF_ELECTION*] → DAY_DISCUSSION → DAY_VOTING → NIGHT → ...
```

> \*The sheriff election occurs only once, after the first night.

### Phase Transition Rules

| From             | To               | Condition                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| SETUP            | NIGHT            | The game starts and `round_number` is set to 1          |
| NIGHT            | SHERIFF_ELECTION | Round 1, and the sheriff election has not yet been held |
| NIGHT            | DAY_DISCUSSION   | Round > 1, or the sheriff election has already finished |
| SHERIFF_ELECTION | DAY_DISCUSSION   | The election ends                                       |
| DAY_DISCUSSION   | DAY_VOTING       | The discussion ends                                     |
| DAY_VOTING       | NIGHT            | Voting ends, and `round_number + 1`                     |

Source: `game_state.py` - `next_phase()`

### Per-Round State Reset

When transitioning from DAY_VOTING back to NIGHT, the following state is cleared:

- `night_deaths`, `day_deaths`, `death_abilities_used`, `death_causes`
- `votes` (daytime votes)
- `werewolf_target`, `werewolf_votes`
- `witch_saved_target`, `witch_poison_target`
- `guard_protected`, `guardian_wolf_protected`
- `nightmare_blocked`, `raven_marked`

Source: `game_state.py` - `next_phase()`, `reset_deaths()`

### When Victory Is Checked

Victory conditions are checked at the following points:

1. After the night phase ends (after death resolution)
2. After the sheriff election
3. After the voting phase ends (after exile resolution)

If a winner is detected at any of these points, the game ends immediately.

Source: `engine/base.py` - `play_game()`

## 4. Night Phase

### Night Action Priority Order

Actions are executed in **descending priority order** (higher numbers act first):

| Order | Priority | Role                                                    |
| ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | 100      | **Cupid** (first night only)                            |
| 2     | 98       | **Nightmare Wolf** (ability block)                      |
| 3     | 95       | **Thief** (first night only; not currently implemented) |
| 4     | 90       | **Guard** / **Guardian Wolf**                           |
| 5     | 80       | **Werewolf** (all werewolf roles vote collectively)     |
| 6     | 75       | **White Wolf** (extra kill)                             |
| 7     | 70       | **Witch** (antidote / poison)                           |
| 8     | 60       | **Seer**                                                |
| 9     | 50       | **Graveyard Keeper**                                    |
| 10    | 40       | **Raven**                                               |

Source: `types/enums.py` - `ActionPriority`, `engine/action_processor.py`

### Werewolf Discussion and Voting

1. If multiple werewolves are alive, they first hold an **internal discussion**, with each werewolf sharing an opinion.
2. Each werewolf then casts an **individual vote** for one non-werewolf target.
3. The player with the **most votes** becomes the kill target.
4. **Tie handling**: if multiple targets are tied, **one is chosen at random**.
5. Werewolves may only target **living non-werewolf** players.

Source: `engine/night_phase.py` - `_run_werewolf_discussion()`, `_resolve_werewolf_votes()`

### Nightmare Wolf Blocking Mechanic

- The Nightmare Wolf may block one player's ability each night.
- For a blocked player, `has_night_action()` returns `False`, and their action is skipped in `process_actions()`.
- The Nightmare Wolf's own blocking action **cannot itself be blocked**.
- The block target may be any living player except the Nightmare Wolf.

Source: `roles/base.py` - `has_night_action()`, `engine/action_processor.py` - `_is_actor_blocked()`

### Night Death Resolution Order

After all night actions have been processed:

1. **Werewolf kill resolution** (checked in order: Witch antidote -> Guard protection -> Elder extra life -> otherwise death)
2. **Witch poison resolution**
3. **Wolf Beauty charm chain** (if Wolf Beauty dies that night, the charmed target dies as well)
4. **Death-triggered abilities** (Sheriff badge transfer -> Hunter / Alpha Wolf shooting)

> Note: lovers' suicide is triggered immediately whenever each individual death event occurs, including inside steps 1 and 2. It is not a separate step.

Source: `engine/death_handler.py` - `resolve_deaths()`

---

## 5. Day Phase

### Discussion Phase Rules

1. **All living players** speak in sequence, one at a time.
2. Each player receives the following information:
    - their own role
    - the list of players who died last night, or a peaceful night message if no one died
    - the list of living players
    - their own action history
    - the full public discussion history from previous rounds
3. Each player gives a **1-3 sentence** statement.
4. All statements are added to the **public discussion history** and are visible to everyone.

Source: `engine/day_phase.py` - `run_day_phase()`, `_build_discussion_context()`

## 6. Voting Phase

### Voting Rules

| Rule            | Details                                                                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who can vote    | All living players with voting rights (`can_vote() == True`)                                       |
| Valid targets   | Any living player (**cannot vote for yourself**)                                                   |
| Vote weight     | Normal player = **1.0**, Sheriff = **1.5**                                                         |
| Raven mark      | A marked player receives an extra **+1 vote**                                                      |
| Exile rule      | The player with the **most votes** is exiled                                                       |
| Tie handling    | **No one is exiled**                                                                               |
| Idiot exception | The Idiot reveals their identity, **does not die**, but permanently loses voting rights            |
| Elder exception | If the Elder is exiled by vote -> **all Villager Camp special abilities are permanently disabled** |

Source: `engine/voting_phase.py`, `game_state.py` - `get_vote_counts()`, `player.py` - `get_vote_weight()`

### Post-Exile Chain Reactions (Daytime)

After a player is exiled by vote, the following are processed in order:

1. Check the **Elder penalty** (all villager abilities become disabled)
2. Check **lovers' suicide** (the partner dies of heartbreak)
3. Check the **Wolf Beauty charm chain** (the charmed target dies as well)
4. Process **death-triggered abilities** (Sheriff badge transfer -> Hunter / Alpha Wolf shooting)

Source: `engine/voting_phase.py` - `_eliminate_voted_player()`, `run_voting_phase()`

---

## 7. Sheriff System

### Election Flow (Round 1 Only)

1. **Candidacy**: all living players are asked whether they want to run for Sheriff.
2. **Automatic election**: if there is only 1 candidate, that player wins automatically.
3. **Speech**: each candidate gives a 2-3 sentence campaign speech.
4. **Voting**: all living players vote for one candidate. Abstaining is allowed, and players cannot vote for themselves.
5. **Result**:
    - A single top vote-getter -> becomes Sheriff
    - A tie -> **no one is elected**

Source: `engine/sheriff_election.py`

### Sheriff Privileges

| Privilege      | Details                                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Weighted vote  | **1.5x** vote weight (normal players have 1.0)                              |
| Badge transfer | Upon death, the Sheriff may transfer the badge to a living player           |
| Destroy badge  | Upon death, the Sheriff may destroy the badge, leaving no Sheriff afterward |

Source: `player.py` - `get_vote_weight()`, `engine/death_handler.py` - `_handle_sheriff_badge_transfer()`

### Sheriff Death Handling

When the Sheriff dies:

1. The Sheriff's agent is asked to **choose one living player** to receive the badge.
2. Or it may choose to **skip** (destroy the badge, with `allow_skip=True`).
3. If there are no living players or no agent, the badge is destroyed automatically.

## 11. Victory Conditions

Victory conditions are checked in the following **strict priority order**. The game ends as soon as the first satisfied condition is found.

### Priority 1: Lovers Victory

- **Condition**: exactly 2 players remain alive, and both are lovers.
- **Winners**: those two lovers.

### Priority 2: Werewolf Victory

- **Condition**: the number of living werewolves is greater than or equal to the number of living villagers, and the number of werewolves is greater than 0.
- **Exception**: an untransformed Blood Moon Apostle **does not count** toward the werewolf total.
- **Winners**: all surviving Werewolf Camp players, including untransformed Blood Moon Apostles.

### Priority 3: Villager Victory

- **Condition**: all werewolves have been eliminated (`living_werewolves = 0`).
- **Exception**: a Blood Moon Apostle counts as a **werewolf** whether transformed or not, and must also be eliminated.
- **Winners**: all surviving Villager Camp players.

## 12. Death Resolution

### Werewolf Kill Resolution

After the werewolves choose a target, the following checks occur in order:

1. **Witch antidote**: if `witch_saved_target == target` -> the target **survives**
2. **Guard protection**: if `guard_protected == target` -> the target **survives**
3. **Elder extra life**: if the target is the Elder and `lives > 1` -> the target **loses one life but survives**
4. **Otherwise**: the target **dies**

> Note: Guard protection and the Witch antidote are checked independently in an `if/elif` structure. There is **no** rule where "double protection causes death." If both apply to the same target, the Witch antidote is checked first and the target still survives.

Source: `engine/death_handler.py` - `_handle_werewolf_kill()`

### Witch Poison Resolution

- The poisoned target dies immediately (**ignores all protection**).
- The cause of death is recorded as `"witch_poison"`.
- This can trigger the lovers' suicide chain if applicable.

Source: `engine/death_handler.py` - `_resolve_witch_poison_death()`

### Death-Triggered Abilities

When a player with a death-triggered ability (Hunter or Alpha Wolf) dies:

1. Check the cause of death. If it is `"witch_poison"`, the ability is **disabled** and the player cannot shoot.
2. Otherwise, the player may **choose one living player to shoot**.
3. The shot target dies immediately.
4. If the shot target is a lover, that lover's partner also dies of heartbreak.

Source: `engine/death_handler.py` - `_handle_death_abilities()`, `_process_hunter_or_alpha_death()`

### Wolf Beauty Charm Chain

- When Wolf Beauty dies, the charmed target also dies if still alive.
- This triggers whether Wolf Beauty dies at night or during the day.

Source: `engine/death_handler.py` - `_handle_wolf_beauty_charm_death()`, `_resolve_wolf_beauty_charm_deaths()`

### Lovers' Suicide Chain

- When one lover dies, the other immediately dies of heartbreak.
- This can trigger during both night and day death resolution.

Source: `engine/death_handler.py` - `_handle_lover_death()`

---

## 13. Special Mechanics

### Guard + Witch Antidote Interaction

- They are resolved independently, and either one can stop a werewolf kill.
- In the current implementation, there is **no** mutually exclusive rule where double protection causes death.

### Ability Disable Mechanic

- `role.disabled = True` prevents a role from acting at night.
- It is triggered by the **Elder penalty** (Elder exiled by vote -> all Villager Camp abilities are disabled).
- It is checked in `Role.can_act_tonight()`.

Source: `roles/base.py` - `can_act_tonight()`

### Ability Usage Limits

- Roles with `max_uses` can only use their abilities a limited number of times.
- Usage is tracked by the `role.ability_uses` counter.
- This is checked in `Role.can_act_tonight()`.

### Discussion History

- **Public discussion history**: accumulates across rounds and is visible to all players during the day and voting phases.
- **Internal werewolf discussion history**: accumulates across rounds and is visible only to werewolves during night discussion.

### Action History

- Each player's agent maintains a personal **action history** of that player's own actions and statements.
- This history is provided as context for later decisions.
- It includes only the player's own actions and excludes other players' sensitive information.
